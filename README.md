RNN, GRU, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM and DistilBERT with an accuracy of 84%, 93.20%, 93.26%,92.99% and 97.75% respectively and finally deploy the model using Telegram bot with detect the message and in suicidal case it respond give some motivation and inform their friends and relative.
Dataset: The dataset, curated by Nikhileswar Komati and publicly available on Kaggle, comprises posts obtained from the "SuicideWatch" subreddits on the Reddit platform. These posts were collected using the Pushshift API, encompassing all posts made between December 16, 2008, and January 2, 2021. The dataset consists of 237,074 data points and is divided into two categories: suicide and non-suicide, with an equal distribution of 116,037 data points in each category. On average, the length of each data point in the dataset is approximately 700 words. However, due to resource limitations, our study focuses on a subset of 120,000 randomly selected data points, with an equal distribution of 60,000 data points for both the suicide and non-suicide categories. Notably, the newly constructed dataset does not contain any null values in the text or class values.
