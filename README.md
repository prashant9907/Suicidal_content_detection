The advent of social media has transformed the way we communicate and connect, enabling individuals worldwide to instantly and openly interact with friends, family, and colleagues on a frequent basis. Moreover, it has facilitated the establishment of new relationships. People utilize social media platforms as a means to express their opinions, share personal experiences, narratives, and challenges. Nevertheless, concerns have arisen due to the growing prevalence of suicidal content on social media platforms, where discussions of hardship, thoughts of death, and self-harm are widespread, particularly among younger generations. Consequently, harnessing the power of social media to detect and identify suicidal behavior, including the presence of suicidal thoughts, becomes essential in offering appropriate interventions that discourage self-harm and suicide, as well as in preventing the spread of suicidal ideations throughout these platforms. This paper present a suicidal content detection using various deep learning architecture  like RNN, GRU, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM and DistilBERT with an accuracy of 84%, 93.20%, 93.26%,92.99% and 97.75% respectively and finally deploy the model using Telegram bot with detect the message and in suicidal case it respond give some motivation and inform their friends and relative.
